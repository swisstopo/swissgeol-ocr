    longDescription: >-
      An end-to-end OCR pipeline (from raw scanned PDF file to searchable PDF
      file) based on the AWS Textract cloud service 
      (https://aws.amazon.com/de/textract/).

      This pipeline was developed by the Swiss Federal Office of Topography
      swisstopo. At swisstopo, it is used for digitising geological documents 
      for internal use as well as for publication on the swissgeol.ch platform.
      In particular, the OCR pipeline has been integrated in the web applications
      assets.swissgeol.ch and boreholes.swissgeol.ch.

      The pipeline can be run as a Python script (processing either local files
      or objects in an S3 bucket) or deployed as an API (processing objects in
      an S3 bucket).

      The overall pipeline functionality is similar to the OCRmyPDF software, but 
      with AWS Textract as the underlying OCR model instead of Tesseract. Users who
      have strong requirements regarding data protection, data soveriegnty or model
      transparency might perfer an open source OCR model such as Tesseract. On the
      other hand, a commercial API such as AWS Textract brings advantages such as
      scalability and high OCR quality at a relatively small price per page. 
      Swisstopo's motivation for using AWS Textract and developing this OCR pipeline 
      is documented in more detail on GitHub.
    features:
      - Call the AWS Textract OCR model for one or several PDF files
      - Create a new PDF file where you can select / search for text in any PDF viewer
      - Detect and skip digitally born PDF pages
      - Remove existing hidden text from previous OCR runs and re-apply OCR
      - Apply useful preprocessing steps (scaling, cropping, image format conversion)
      - Cut large pages into smaller sections before they are sent to AWS Textract
      - Add metadata to an S3 object after processing
