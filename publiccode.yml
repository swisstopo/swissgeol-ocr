    shortDescription: End-to-end OCR pipeline (from raw scanned PDF to searchable
      PDF) based on the AWS Textract cloud service
    longDescription: An end-to-end OCR pipeline (from raw scanned PDF file to searchable PDF file) based on 
      the [AWS Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/de/textract/) cloud service.
      
      This pipeline was developed by the Swiss [Federal Office of Topography 
      swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/). At swisstopo, it is used for digitising geological 
      documents for internal use as well as for publication on the [swissgeol.ch](https://www.swissgeol.ch/) 
      platform. In particular, the OCR pipeline has been integrated in the web applications 
      [assets.swissgeol.ch](https://assets.swissgeol.ch/) and 
      [boreholes.swissgeol.ch](https://boreholes.swissgeol.ch/).
      
      The pipeline can be run as a Python script (processing either local files or objects in an S3 bucket) or 
      deployed as an API (processing objects in an S3 bucket).

      The overall pipeline functionality is similar to the [OCRmyPDF](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
      software, but with AWS Textract as the underlying OCR model instead of 
      [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/). If you have strong requirements regarding data protection, 
      data soveriegnty or model transparency, then an open source OCR model such as Tesseract might be preferrable. 
      On the other hand, a commercial API such as AWS Textract brings advantages such as scalability and high 
      OCR quality at a relatively small price per page. Swisstopo's motivation for using AWS Textract and 
      developing an OCR pipeline in this way is documented in more detail on the page 
      [docs/**Motivation.md**](https://github.com/swisstopo/swissgeol-ocr/blob/develop/docs/Motivation.md).
    features:
    - Creates a new PDF file where the text detected by the AWS Textract OCR model can be selected 
      and searched for text in any PDF viewer.
    - PDF pages that are "digitally born" are detected and skipped when applying OCR.
    - For PDF files that were previously processed by a different OCR pipeline, existing hidden text is 
      removed, and OCR is re-applied, ensuring consistent OCR quality.
    - Applies useful preprocessing steps such as scaling of PDF pages with incorrect dimensions, cropping 
      of images, conversion of JPX images to JPG.
    - Pages with large dimensions are cut into smaller sections, to respect the AWS Textract limits on 
      file size and page dimensions, without compromising on quality.
    - Adds metadata (such as the number of pages in the document) to an S3 object after processing.
