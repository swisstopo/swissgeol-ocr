      End-to-end OCR pipeline (from raw scanned PDF to searchable PDF) based on
      the AWS Textract cloud service
    longDescription: >-
      An end-to-end OCR pipeline (from raw scanned PDF file to searchable PDF
      file) based on the [AWS Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/de/textract/)
      cloud service.

      This pipeline was developed by the Swiss [Federal Office of Topography
      swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/). At swisstopo, it is used for
      digitising geological documents for internal use as well as for
      publication on the [swissgeol.ch](https://www.swissgeol.ch/) platform. In
      particular, the OCR pipeline has been integrated in the web applications
      [assets.swissgeol.ch](https://assets.swissgeol.ch/) and
      [boreholes.swissgeol.ch](https://boreholes.swissgeol.ch/).

      The pipeline can be run as a Python script (processing either local files
      or objects in an S3 bucket) or deployed as an API (processing objects in
      an S3 bucket).

      The overall pipeline functionality is similar to the
      [OCRmyPDF](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) software, but with
      AWS Textract as the underlying OCR model instead of
      [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/). If you have strong
      requirements regarding data protection, data soveriegnty or model
      transparency, then an open source OCR model such as Tesseract might be
      preferrable. On the other hand, a commercial API such as AWS Textract
      brings advantages such as scalability and high OCR quality at a relatively
      small price per page. Swisstopo's motivation for using AWS Textract and
      developing an OCR pipeline in this way is documented in more detail on the
      page
      [docs/**Motivation.md**](https://github.com/swisstopo/swissgeol-ocr/blob/develop/docs/Motivation.md).
    features:
      - Call the AWS Textract OCR model for one or several PDF files
      - Create a new PDF file where you can select / search for text in any PDF viewer
      - Detect and skip digitally born PDF pages
      - Remove existing hidden text from previous OCR runs and re-apply OCR
      - Apply useful preprocessing steps (scaling, cropping, image format conversion)
      - Cut large pages into smaller sections before they are sent to AWS Textract
      - Add metadata to an S3 object after processing
